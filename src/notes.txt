What will it be?
================

Walks varying in difficulty and length with a good description and map to 
follow.

Some local info/history about the route.

The map should have numbered locations that refer to numbered locations on the
description so that it's difficult to go wrong.

Walks will be graded 1 to 5 and marked for wheelchair access if appropriate.

- Printable maps and directions.
- Links to local places to eat and stay.
